Prompt: 
    Given 4 input numbers labeled A, B, C, D: labeled as "Input: A B C D".
    Select two numbers and an arithmetic operator from the list of operators (+, -, *, /) to form a valid expression. The expression should evaluate to the third number R.
    For example if A and B are chosen as the operand and * is the operator, it will generate a line: "A * B = R (left: R C D)", where C and D are the remaining unused/ left out numbers. 
    Repeat selection and evaluation of expression and output format, and list it as output 
    Here is an example in double quotes:
    "Input: 2 8 8 14
    Possible next steps:
    2 + 8 = 10 (left: 10 8 14)
    8 / 2 = 4 (left: 4 8 14)
